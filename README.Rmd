## Overview

The `speed` package optimises spatial experimental designs by rearranging treatments to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining statistical validity. It uses simulated annealing to:

- Minimise treatment adjacency (reducing neighbour effects)
- Maintain spatial balance across rows and columns
- Respect blocking constraints if specified
- Provide visualisation tools for design evaluation

## Installation

You can install the development version of speed from [GitHub](https://github.com/biometryhub/speed) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("biometryhub/speed")
```

## Features

- Flexible optimisation of experimental designs
- Support for blocked designs
- Customisable optimisation parameters
- Built-in visualisation functions
- Progress tracking during optimisation
- Early stopping when convergence is reached

See the package documentation for more detailed examples and options.

## Example

### Basic

A simple example optimising a 4Ã—3 completely randomised design with 4 treatments:

```{r example}
library(speed)

# Create a simple design with 3 replicates of 4 treatments
df <- data.frame(
  row = rep(1:4, each = 3),
  col = rep(1:3, times = 4),
  treatment = rep(LETTERS[1:4], each = 3)
)

# Optimise the design with seed for reproducibility
result <- speed(df, "treatment", seed = 42)

# Plot the optimised design
autoplot(result)

# View optimisation progress
plot_progress(result)
```

### Blocked design

You can also optimise designs within blocks:

```{r blocks}
# Create a design with blocks
df <- data.frame(
  row = rep(1:6, each = 4),
  col = rep(1:4, times = 6),
  treatment = rep(LETTERS[1:8], 3),
  block = rep(1:3, each = 8)
)

# Optimise while respecting blocks
result <- speed(df,
  "treatment",
  swap_within = "block",
  iterations = 5000,
  seed = 42
)

# Plot the design with block boundaries
autoplot(result)
```
