Description: The Speed package optimises spatial experimental designs by rearranging 
    treatments to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining statistical validity. 
    It employs customisable optimisation metrics, with a default approach that balances 
    minimising treatment adjacency and maintaining spatial balance. Users can supply their 
    own optimisation metrics to tailor designs to specific experimental requirements. 
    The package also includes visualisation tools that allow users to inspect 
    optimised designs.
