# speed 0.0.9

## Major Changes

- Added `calculate_pair_incidence()` to return a symmetric treatment × treatment matrix of neighbour-pair counts.
- Added `calculate_position_incidence()` to return treatment × row/column position count matrices.

# speed 0.0.8

## Major Changes

- Added `ring_dists`, `ring_weights`, and `ring_type` arguments to `calculate_adjacency_score` for weighting
  matches at larger adjacent ring radii; can be passed via `speed()`.

# speed 0.0.7

## Major Changes

- Added `splits` argument to `initialise_design_df` to support split-plot designs (#92).
- Added `main_weight` and `interaction_weight` arguments to `objective_function_factorial` to tune the trade-off 
  between main-treatment and interaction balance (#90).

## Minor Changes

- Fixed `autoplot.design` where `'block'` column was required when providing another column for `block` (#88).

# speed 0.0.6

## Major Changes

- Extended `random_initialise` to handle hierarchical (multi-level) `optimise` lists by shuffling within each
  level's grouping.

# speed 0.0.5

## Major Changes

- Added `objective_function_factorial` for factorial designs, combining main-treatment and interaction balance
  scores (#78).

# speed 0.0.4

## Major Changes

- Added vignettes for MET (#70) and factorial (#71) designs.

# speed 0.0.3

## Major Changes

- Optimisation parameters were changed from options to arguments to enable better reproducibility of designs (#65
- Enabled one stage MET designs
- Added contributing guide and code of conduct (#59)

See changelog for further details.

# speed 0.0.2

## Major Changes

- Enabled more complex designs and added some vignettes with examples and detailed use.

See changelog for further details.
