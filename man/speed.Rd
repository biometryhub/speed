\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the experimental design with spatial
coordinates}

\item{swap}{A column name of the items to be swapped (e.g., \code{treatment},
\code{variety}, \code{genotype}, etc). For hierarchical designs, provide a named
list where each name corresponds to a hierarchy level (e.g.,
\code{list(wp = "wholeplot_treatment", sp = "subplot_treatment")}).
See details for more information.}

\item{swap_within}{A string specifying the variable that defines a boundary
within which to swap treatments. Specify \code{"1"} or \code{"none"} for no boundary
(default: \code{"1"}). Other examples might be \code{"block"} or \code{"replicate"} or
even \code{"site"}. For hierarchical designs, provide a named list with names
matching \code{swap} to optimise a hierarchical design such as a split-plot.
See details for more information.}

\item{spatial_factors}{A one-sided formula specifying spatial factors to
consider for balance (default: \code{~row + col}).}

\item{grid_factors}{A named list specifying grid factors to construct a
matrix for calculating adjacency score, \code{dim1} for row and \code{dim2} for
column. (default: \code{list(dim1 = "row", dim2 = "col")}).}

\item{iterations}{Maximum number of iterations for the simulated annealing
algorithm (default: 10000). For hierarchical designs, can be a named list
with names matching \code{swap}.}

\item{early_stop_iterations}{Number of iterations without improvement before
early stopping (default: 2000). For hierarchical designs, can be a named
list with names matching \code{swap}.}

\item{obj_function}{Objective function used to calculate score (lower is
better) (default: \code{\link[=objective_function]{objective_function()}}). For hierarchical designs, can
be a named list with names matching \code{swap}.}

\item{swap_all}{Logical; Whether to swap all matching items or a single item
at a time (default: FALSE)}

\item{optimise}{A list of named arguments describing optimising parameters;
see more in example.}

\item{optimise_params}{Parameters used to control the behaviour of
simulated annealing algorithm. See \code{\link[=optim_params]{optim_params()}} for more details.}

\item{quiet}{Logical; if TRUE, suppresses progress messages (default: FALSE)}

\item{seed}{A numeric value for random seed. If provided, it ensures
reproducibility of results (default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed through to objective functions.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{design_df} - Data frame of optimised design
\item \strong{score} - Final optimisation score
\item \strong{scores} - Vector of scores across iterations (for simple designs) or
named list of score vectors (for hierarchical designs)
\item \strong{temperatures} - Vector of temperatures across iterations
\item \strong{iterations_run} - Total number of iterations performed
\item \strong{stopped_early} - Logical indicating if optimisation stopped early
(for simple designs) or named logical vector (for hierarchical designs)
\item \strong{treatments} - Vector of unique treatments (for simple designs) or
named list of treatment vectors (for hierarchical designs)
\item \strong{seed} - Random seed used for reproducibility of the design. If not set
in the function, the seed is set to the third element of \code{.Random.seed}.

\description{
Optimises the spatial layout of experimental designs using simulated
annealing to minimise treatment adjacency and maintain treatment balance
across spatial factors. Works with regular or irregular spatial designs.
}
\details{
This function provides a very general interface for producing experimental
designs of different types. For hierarchical designs such as split-plots,
strip plots, split-split plots and similar nested structures, the key
arguments (\code{swap}, \code{swap_within}, \code{iterations}, \code{early_stop_iterations} and
\code{obj_function}) can be provided as named lists where each name corresponds
to a level in the hierarchy (e.g., "wholeplot", "subplot"). When these
arguments are provided as named lists with matching names, the optimisation
is applied sequentially at each hierarchical level, starting with the first
level and progressing through the hierarchy. This allows for different
optimisation parameters and objective functions to be applied at different
levels of the design structure. For simple (non-hierarchical) designs, these
arguments can be provided as single values. For more examples and detailed
usage, see the package vignettes.
