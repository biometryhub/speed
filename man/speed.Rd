\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the experimental design with spatial
coordinates}

\item{swap}{A column name of the items to be swapped (e.g., \code{treatment},
\code{variety}, \code{genotype}, etc). Can also be a named list to optimise a
hierarchical design such as a split-plot. See details for more information.}

\item{swap_within}{A string specifying the variable that defines a boundary
within which to swap treatments. Specify \code{"1"} or \code{"none"} for no boundary
(default: \code{"1"}). Other examples might be \code{"block"} or \code{"replicate"} or
even \code{"site"}. Can also be a named list with names matching \code{swap} to
optimise a hierarchical design such as a split-plot. See details for more
information.}

\item{spatial_factors}{A one-sided formula specifying spatial factors to
consider for balance (default: \code{~row + col}).}

\item{iterations}{Maximum number of iterations for the simulated annealing
algorithm (default: 10000). Can also be a named list.}

\item{early_stop_iterations}{Number of iterations without improvement before
early stopping (default: 2000). Can also be a named list.}

\item{obj_function}{Objective function used to calculate score (lower is
better) (default: \code{\link[=objective_function]{objective_function()}}). Can also be a named list.}

\item{quiet}{Logical; if TRUE, suppresses progress messages (default: FALSE)}

\item{seed}{A numeric value for random seed. If provided, it ensures
reproducibility of results (default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed through to objective functions.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{design_df} - Data frame of optimised design
\item \strong{score} - Final optimization score
\item \strong{scores} - Vector or list of scores across iterations
\item \strong{temperatures} - Vector of temperatures across iterations
\item \strong{iterations_run} - Total number of iterations performed
\item \strong{stopped_early} - Logical indicating if optimization stopped early
\item \strong{treatments} - Vector or list of unique treatments
\item \strong{seed} - Random seed used for reproducibility of the design. If not set
in the function, the seed is set to the third element of \code{.Random.seed}.

\description{
Optimises the spatial layout of experimental designs using simulated
annealing to minimize treatment adjacency and maintain treatment balance
across spatial factors. Works with regular or irregular spatial designs.
