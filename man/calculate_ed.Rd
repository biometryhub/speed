\title{Even Distribution Calculation}
\usage{
calculate_ed(design_matrix, previous_ed = NULL, swapped_items = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_ed}{Named list of the previous ed calculation}
}
\value{
Named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \if{html}{\out{<number of replications>}} - Named list containing:
\itemize{
\item msts - Named list of items and their mst
\item min_mst - The lowest mst
\item min_items - Pairs of items with the lowest mst
}
