\usage{
calculate_ed(design_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_matrix}{A matrix representing the design}

\item{current_ed}{Named list of the current ed calculation}

\item{swapped_items}{The items that had just been swapped}
}
\value{
Named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \if{html}{\out{<number of replications>}} - Named list containing:
\itemize{
\item msts - Named list of items and their mst
