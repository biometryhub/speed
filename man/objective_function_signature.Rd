\usage{
objective_function_signature(
  design_matrix,

  swap,
  spatial_cols,
  previous_score,
  swapped_items
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_matrix}{A design matrix}

\item{layout_df}{A data frame representing the spatial information of the design}

\item{swap}{A column name of the items}

\item{spatial_cols}{Column names of the spatial factors}

\item{previous_score}{A named list of numeric values with one required name \code{score} representing the score of
the design (lower is better)}

\item{swapped_items}{Items which were swapped during the current iteration}
}
\value{
A named list of numeric values with one required name \code{score} representing the score of the design
(lower is better)
}

A signature for an objective function
