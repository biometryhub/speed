\arguments{
\item{swap_count}{Number of treatment swaps per iteration (default: 1).}

\item{swap_all_blocks}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, performs swaps in all blocks at each iteration (default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{adaptive_swaps}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adjusts swap parameters based on temperature (default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{start_temp}{Starting temperature for simulated annealing (default: 100). A higher start temperature
allows the algorithm to accept worse solutions early on, encouraging exploration of the solution space and
helping to avoid local optima. Lower values make the algorithm greedier from the start, which can speed up
convergence but increases the risk of getting stuck in a poor solution. A good starting temperature allows
moderately worse solutions to be accepted with a probability of 70–90\% at the beginning of the optimisation.}

\item{cooling_rate}{Rate at which temperature decreases for simulated annealing (default: 0.99). This
controls how quickly the algorithm shifts from exploration to exploitation. The temperature is updated at
each iteration by multiplying it by this rate: \code{T_i = start_temp * cooling_rate^i}. A higher cooling rate
(e.g. 0.995–0.999) results in slower cooling and a longer exploration phase, which is generally better for
complex or noisy optimisation landscapes. Lower values (e.g. 0.95–0.98) cool quickly, leading to faster
convergence but greater risk of premature convergence to a suboptimal design.}

\item{random_initialisation}{Number of times to randomly shuffle items within \code{swap_within}; the design with
the best score is used as an initial design (default: 0).}

\item{adj_weight}{Weight for adjacency score (default: 1).}

\item{bal_weight}{Weight for balance score (default: 1).}
