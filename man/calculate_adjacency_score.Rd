\title{Calculate Adjacency Score for Experimental Design}
\usage{
calculate_adjacency_score(design)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A matrix containing the experimental design layout with treatments}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the total number of adjacent same treatments.
The score is the sum of same treatments that are adjacent horizontally
and vertically.
}
\description{
Calculates the number of adjacent treatments that are the same in an experimental
design layout. Lower scores indicate better separation of treatments.
}
\examples{
design <- matrix(c("A", "B", "A",
                   "B", "A", "B",
                   "A", "B", "A"), 
                 nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
calculate_adjacency_score(design)  # Returns the number of adjacent matches
