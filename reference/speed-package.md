# speed: Generate Spatially Efficient Experimental Designs

The Speed package optimises spatial experimental designs by rearranging
treatments to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining
statistical validity. It employs customisable optimisation metrics, with
a default approach that balances minimising treatment adjacency and
maintaining spatial balance. Users can supply their own optimisation
metrics to tailor designs to specific experimental requirements. The
package also includes visualisation tools that allow users to inspect
optimised designs.
